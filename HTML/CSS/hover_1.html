            Naruto[a] is a Japanese manga series 
            written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto.
            It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young
             ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and 
             dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of 
             his village. The story is told in two parts â€“ 
             the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and
              the second in his teens. The series is based 
              on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri 
              (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable 
              mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award
               the following year, and Naruto (1997).
